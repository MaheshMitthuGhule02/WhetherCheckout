## Features
- Display current weather conditions for a specified location.
- Responsive user interface.
- Search functionality to find weather details for different cities.
- User-friendly design with clear and concise information.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Java, JSP, Servlets
- **Database**: MySQL (if any user-specific data is stored)
- **API**: Third-party weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
- **IDE**: Eclipse IDE or any Java IDE
- **Server**: Apache Tomcat

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
